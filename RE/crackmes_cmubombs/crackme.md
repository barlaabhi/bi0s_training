crackme0x01:
		
		here the input is compared to 5274, which when given as input prints password ok! 


crackme0x02:
		
		In this challenge, a few arthematic operations are done and then the resultant value is 
		compared with  338724, which when given as input prints password ok!

crackme0x03:
		
		this is same as above challenge, we here additionally have a test function, which will
		call shift function which basically prints the string 	password ok! when 338724 is given as input

crackme0x04:
		
		Here the sum of the digits in the number given as input are compared with 15,
		which when satisfied prints password ok!

crackme0x05:
		
		Here to get the output as password ok!, the number given as input must have
		sum of digits as 16, and the least significant bit of the number must  be zero  

crackme0x06:
		
		This is same as above challenge, only difference is that the program checks for an environment 
		variable with the first three characters to be "LOL", which when satisfied prints password ok!

crackme0x07:
		
		This program runs same as above one, the difference here is that the binary is stripped
		the solution i.e the sum of digits of inputs should be equal to 16 with 
		lsb=0 and an environment variable with the first three characters to be "LOL"

crackme0x08:
		
		the only difference is that we set a variable in the data segment and compare with the 
		same value, which would always be true and the the solution i.e the sum of digits of inputs should 
		be equal to 16 and an environment variable with the first three characters to be "LOL"
		
crackme0x09:
		
		this is same as 0x8 but here the binary is stripped
			
			
crackme0x00a:
		
		we have a strcmp function which compares the input with the string g00dJ0B, 
		which when given as input prints password ok!

crackme0x00b:
		
		here wcscmp is wide character equivalent of strcmp where each character is 4 byte long, 
		checking the argument passed to the function we get the input string compared to  w0wgreat,
		giving it as input prints password ok!
